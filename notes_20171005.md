Troubleshooting notes from 20171005
=================

I got `requests` installed on OpenRefine, and got the script working in OpenRefine. See below for details:

- download jython2.7+
- download JDK 8 or newer (most up to date JDK)
- install ez_setup.py
- run `jython ez_setup.py`
- run `jython -m pip install requests==2.11.1` <- you need `requests` version 2.11.1 or older for it to work
	- there's a compatability problem with `requests` version 2.12.0 and newer. see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/3992)
- see [jythonURLRedirect.py](jythonURLRedirect.py) for the script to run
- it took 3 minutes to redirect the first 19 URLs
- it took 2 minutes to run the next 10 URLs
- the problem might lie with the DOI URLs (the URLs that start with "http://link.springer.com/10.")

## Next Steps

- test script with DOI URLs excluded and see if that makes the script run faster
